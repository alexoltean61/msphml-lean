This thesis presents a formalization of many-sorted polyadic hybrid modal logic within the Lean 4 proof assistant. Our primary contribution is a machine-checked proof of its soundness theorem and the development of the necessary framework for its Henkin completeness proof. While the soundness proof is fully mechanized, we outline definite directions for future work to complete the formalization of completeness and showcase its applicability to the operational semantics of operational semantics. All code and formalizations are available in the public repository: https://github.com/alexoltean61/msphml-lean
